key	reason	explanation	explanationDetail
technical_failure	Technical failure	Whole Genome Sequencing could not be successfully performed on the received biomaterial(s) due to technical problems.
sufficient_tcp_qc_failure	Insufficient quality of received biomaterial(s)	The received biomaterial(s) did not meet the requirements that are needed for high quality Whole Genome Sequencing.	The tumor percentage based on molecular estimation was above the minimal of 20% tumor cells but could not be further analyzed due to insufficient quality.
insufficient_tcp_shallow_wgs	Insufficient quality of received biomaterial(s)	The received biomaterial(s) did not meet the requirements that are needed for high quality Whole Genome Sequencing.	The tumor percentage based on molecular estimation was below the minimal of 20% tumor cells and could not be further analyzed.
insufficient_tcp_deep_wgs	Insufficient quality of received biomaterial(s)	The received biomaterial(s) did not meet the requirements that are needed for high quality Whole Genome Sequencing.	The tumor percentage based on molecular estimation was below the minimal of 20% tumor cells and could not be further analyzed.
insufficient_dna	Insufficient quality of received biomaterial(s)	The received biomaterial(s) did not meet the requirements that are needed for high quality Whole Genome Sequencing.	Sequencing could not be performed due to insufficient DNA.
insufficient_dna_panel	Insufficient quality of received biomaterial(s)	The received biomaterial(s) did not meet the requirements that are needed for high quality Next Generation Sequencing.	Sequencing could not be performed due to insufficient DNA.
