Melanoma sample sample
- activating BRAF mutation that is associated with response to BRAF-inhibitors (in combination with a MEK-inhibitor)
- complete inactivation of CDKN2A, indicating potential benefit of CDK4/6 inhibitors
- complete inactivation/loss of PTEN likely resulting in an activation of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway and indicating potential benefit of mTOR/PI3K inhibitors
- high mutational burden (mutational load (ML) of 180, tumor mutation burden (TMB) of 13.6) that is potentially associated with an increased response rate to checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy
Due to the lower tumor purity 99% potential (subclonal)
DNA aberrations might not have been detected using this test. This result should therefore be considered with caution.
